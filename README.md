The program is to help users learn about how to reduce their carbon footprint.

Assumptions:

For the project, I am assuming that this is being taught to middle school students using a team-based approach across subject areas. At this point, students will have learned in science class about climate change and the impact of carbon on their environment. In history class, they will have learned about the increase in carbon emissions of humans over time.

This background will allow the computer programming class to focus on the carbon footprint of an individual student and how to reduce it.

Learning Outcome:

The students will learn about their carbon footprint and ways they can change it.  It will use user-centered design principles to help students learn about their personal impacts on global climate change and how they can help the environment by making small changes to their daily routine. The goal will be to encourage students to try various scenarios each time they run the program. They can see that small changes in their life can make a substantial impact on their carbon footprint either positive or negative.

Program:

There are a series of questions that the user will be asked to answer. They include questions on transportation to school, why types of food do they eat, and if they recycle. Depending on their answer a point value will be assigned.

As they progress through the program their “carbon footprint” will continue to be adjusted. When they make good choices, they help reduce their carbon footprint. The goal is to have a carbon footprint be a low as possible.

For example, if they are asked if they ride a bike to school and they answer yes, they start with a 0. If they are asked if they take a car their footprint calculation increases by 1115 (these numbers are from online resources).

When asked if they recycle, they can reduce their carbon footprint total by 19 for recycling plastic, 105 for recycling paper etc. Each step of the way their new carbon footprint number is calculated and store in a variable.

The program is a text-based program and will use if statements, functions, and other programming concepts we learned in the book. The program will also include a heading that will start with presenting the user some information about what the program will do. It will ask them their name and print out the header with the name and a greeting.

The program will end with the option to try again or end. If they had a high carbon footprint the user will be strongly encouraged to try and make different choices and play the game again. If they choose to try again the program will prompt them to answer their questions again. Each time they are making new choices in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint.
